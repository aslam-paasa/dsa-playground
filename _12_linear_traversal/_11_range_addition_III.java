     * 1. The most incremented part of the matrix is the smallest

     *    region have the highest value.

     * SC: O(1) => Only two integer variables minRow and minCol

     * Why is this better?
     * - Avoids matrix updates completely by tracking the smallest
     *   affected region. 
     * - No extra memory usage.
